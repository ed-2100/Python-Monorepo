# Mecanum Simulator

This code was written in a rush by myself, so the commit messages could be better.

- I formatted this code with Black on a whim. I'm not entirely sure that I like it yet.
- `systemgame.py` is playable.
- `goalfinder.py` is only playable once a model has been trained using `ml_trainer.py`
- `motorcurvefitter.py` is used to calculate the motor constants. It is runnable.
